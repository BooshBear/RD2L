# RD2L Inhouse League Rules {title}

1. **How to Join**
   - Join the Discord
     - https://discord.gg/78NeZNn
     - In the #vouch-request channel and post the following information:
       - Steam Name
       - Steam Profile Link
       - DotaBuff Link
       - MMR Screenshot
       - Preferred Roles
       - Have anyone providing references for you post there as well
2. **Procedural Rules**
   - If you join a queue, you must accept the game, select players for your team (if selected as captain), and join the appropriate lobby.
   - Games are to generally be played in Captains Mode or Captains Draft but are ultimately decided by the host.
   - The person selected as Captain is required to draft players, however it is up to them if they want to delegate the task of drafting heroes in game to another player.
   - All players are required to be present in Discord with the rest of their team.
   - In the case of technical issues or disconnects, pause the game immediately - the game may not be un-paused until resolution of the issue or 10 minutes pass, whichever occurs first.
   - While All-Chat banter is generally allowed, if the opposing team asks for no All-Chat please refrain from All-Chatting.
   - Intentionally throwing any games will result in a ban from this IHL.
   - Abuse of the rules must be reported to an inhouse admin in #unvouch-request channel.
   - Failure to follow these procedural rules WILL result in some form of punishment.
3. **Behavioral Rules**
   - Being present in Discord with the team is a requirement, as is communication
   - Some amount of casual flame is inevitable in inhouses. As such, rulings by admins as to what constitutes overly toxic behavior is not set in stone. Most of this will be dealt on a case-by-case basis.
   - No hate speech (speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender).
   - No cyber-bullying.
   - Once a game is over, itâ€™s over. Do not take arguments and flame wars into the Discord.
   - Action is more likely to be taken against you after repeated complaints of poor behavior are reported by multiple individuals.
4. **Punishments**
   - Punishment depends on the severity of the infraction and previous behavioral incidents.
   - Depending on the situation, possible punishments may include a warning, a queue ban lasting between 1 hour and 1 season, or a permanent ban from the inhouse league.
5. **Miscellaneous**
   - Streaming is allowed. However, please add a delay of at least 2 minutes to your stream.
   - Regular RD2L and RD2L Mini games take priority over inhouse games.
